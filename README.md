## 🔍 Overview
The goal of this assignment was to build an interactive Python script that handles various data types and operations. A key focus was implementing data analysis logic (Sum, Max, Min, Average) **manually**, without using Python's built-in functions like `sum()` or `max()`, to demonstrate a deep understanding of loops and conditional logic.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Interactive CLI:** Prompts users for names, ages, and numeric data.
* **Dynamic Grading:** Calculates GPA/Grades based on user-inputted exam scores.
* **Manual Data Processing:** Custom logic to find statistics within a list of numbers.
* **Advanced Calculator:** A robust loop-based calculator with error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs.

## 🛠 Task Breakdown

### A — Basic Level
* **User Greeting:** Accepts name and age, ensuring age is handled as an integer.
* **Basic Arithmetic:** Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division on two user-provided numbers.

### B — Intermediate Level
* **Grading System:** Processes three float-based exam scores.
* **Average Calculation:** Computes the average and assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, F) using logical comparison operators.

### C — Advanced Level
* **Manual Statistics:** Parses a comma-separated string of numbers into an integer list.
* **Logic Implementation:** Uses a `for` loop to manually identify the **Sum**, **Maximum**, **Minimum**, and **Average** of the dataset.

### 🌟 Bonus Challenge: Multi-functional Calculator
* Includes a continuous loop for multiple calculations.
* Supports operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`.
* Includes `try-except` blocks to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.
